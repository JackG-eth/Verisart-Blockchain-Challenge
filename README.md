- Bonus points:
  - smart contracts deployed
  - A way of seeing all created certificates in some kind of list view. Each item in the list view would show a thumbnail of the photo, the title, artist and year of production
  - Manage upload and storage of photos in IPFS
  - A thought through way of modelling "Artists" in the database - Would just store at mint level
  - Allowing a user to edit an existing Certificate - Did not add UI for this (time constraints but there is functionality for this on the smart contract level)
  - Tests for your smart contract
